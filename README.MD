# Exploratory Data Analysis and Web Application

This repository contains code for both an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) as well as a web application.

## Dataset

The dataset being used for this project is the cars.csv dataset from https://corgis-edu.github.io/corgis/csv/cars/. This is a dataset about cars and how much fuel they use.

## Exploratory Data Anaylsis

The EDA is done using a Jupyter Notebook. It explores the data, cleans it and prepares it for loading into a MySQL database. The main library used for this is Pandas.

## Web Application

The web application is written using Express, Mustache & Sequelize. It interfaces with the database to provide insights and answers to the questions that were posed on this dataset.

TODO - Add folder structure description.
TODO - Add setup instructions.
